# Location Services

Location services in the Mapzen Android SDK are powered by the [Location Open Source Tracker (LOST)](https://github.com/mapzen/LOST) project.

That means you can use our SDK on any Android device regardless of whether it supports Google Play services. And we never track users' personal location data. Ever.
